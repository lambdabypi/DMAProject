# Energy Grid Database System
This repo contains our work on a project to handle the data of a large energy grid system. We created a database that handles data for a large enrgy grid that supplies energy to an even larger community. Around 10k rows of data are created to show how it works.

We have used an amalgamation SQL, MongoDB and Python to address this problem
